# Predictive Modeling of Kickstarter Campaign Success

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This project focuses on analyzing and modeling Kickstarter campaign data to understand the key factors that influence whether a project succeeds or fails[cite: 6]. [cite_start]Using a dataset of over 370,000 projects, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and developed predictive models to forecast campaign outcomes.

## Objectives
* [cite_start]**Predict Success**: Build classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to predict if a campaign will meet its funding goal[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Feature Analysis**: Identify important predictors such as funding goal, duration, category, and number of backers[cite: 7, 108].
* [cite_start]**Actionable Insights**: Provide recommendations for creators to design more effective crowdfunding strategies[cite: 11].

## Key Features & Methodology
* [cite_start]**Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and identified outliers using Z-score analysis.
* [cite_start]**Feature Engineering**: Created new metrics like `Duration` (days between launch and deadline) and `Pledged_to_Goal` ratios.
* [cite_start]**EDA**: Visualized project distributions across categories and countries to find success trends.
* [cite_start]**Modeling**: Implemented Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers to achieve high predictive accuracy[cite: 9, 10].

## Technologies Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebooks
